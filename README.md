This is my next project in the Odin Project course
So far I have learnt some basics methods for starting a webpage (text formating and images basically), learnt a bit about Github and basics for using, and learnt a bit about using the linux terminal and command line (which is not so bad to get used as I though, considering that I have been using Windows and the Dos Prompt for about 25 years now...).
Im looking forward to the next steps in learning with the Odin Project and getting back into doing some programing along the way.
